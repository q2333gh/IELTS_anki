## She decided to **abandon** her old car at the mechanic's because it was too expensive to repair.

**Abandon** comes from the Old French word "abandoner," which itself derives from the Latin "abandonare," meaning "to give up, relinquish." The Latin root "ab-" means "away" and "bandon" relates to "power or control."

**Abandon** means to leave something behind or give up completely, often implying that the person leaving has no intention of returning or reclaiming it. It can also mean to cease to support or look after something.
