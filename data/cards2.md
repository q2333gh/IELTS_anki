## The company is facing a financial **deficit**.
Shortfall, deficiency
The word **deficit** comes from the Latin word "deficere," which means "to fail" or "to be lacking." It is made up of the prefix "de-" (down, away) and the root "ficere" (to make, do).
"赤字"这个词来源于拉丁语"deficere"，意为"失败"或"缺乏"。它由前缀"de-"（向下，远离）和词根"ficere"（制造，做）构成。
A **deficit** is a situation where there is a lack or shortage of something, often referring to a financial shortfall where expenses exceed revenue.
